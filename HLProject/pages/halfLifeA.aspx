            Half Life: Alyx (2020) is the long awaited continuation to the beloved Half Life franchise, after 12 years on hiatus.
            The game was recieved with overwhemlingly positive reviews and calls for Valve to continue the series, whose fate is still in doubt, even after the release of this game.

        <p class="gamepagetext">
            Half Life: Alyx's release was a shock to fans all over the globe, because it has been so long since the last games release,
            that many fans gave up hope of another game to come out and refresh the market.
            However, Valve suprised once again by releasing for the first time a full commercial virtual reality FPS title.
        </p>
        <p class="gamepagetext">
            In this game for a change you are put in the shoes of the previous games' supporting character, Alyx Vance, daughter of Eli Vance.
            During your adventure you uncover the true nature of the secret "SuperWeapon" the alien overlords have hidden away in a floating vault, away from all prying eyes.
            You discover how to bring down the vault and venture into it, but it is not what it seems, and unforseen consequences await you inside.
        </p>
        <p class="gamepagetext">
            Half Life: Alyx was the culmination of 9 years of effort from the Valve team, and the finished produc is something to behold.
            Not to mention, that Half Life Alyx is my personal favorite game of all time, it excels at all the mechanics it includes, from the intriguing resource collecting to the action filled gunfights.
        </p>
        <p class="gamepagetext">
            This game is one of the first actual fully completed VR titles on the market, and is still considered one of the best, even today.
            It paved road for other games to improve and inhabit the barren VR genre and expand and build upon its foundations.
